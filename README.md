Youtube-Summarizer
This project aims to simplify the process of extracting and summarizing YouTube video content, making it accessible and comprehensible for diverse audiences.�By integrating advanced AI models for summarization and translation, users can quickly obtain key insights from videos in their preferred language and complexity level. �This tool is particularly useful for students, researchers, and professionals who need to efficiently digest large amounts of video content.

HOW TO USE IT : This project allows users to input a YouTube video link in a Streamlit interface. Using YouTubeTranscriptApi, it extracts the video's transcript. Google's Gemini Pro model then generates a brief summary based on a predefined prompt. Users can view the summary in its original language or translate it using Google Translate API, with an option to download the summarized content for offline use, ensuring convenient access to distilled information from YouTube videos.
